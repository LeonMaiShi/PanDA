Description: This package is designed for pan-cancer differential DNA methylation (DM) 
    analysis. It provides a function that elucidates the underlying data structure of 
    the input summary statistics from multiple cancer types. The learned data characteristics
    are then used to make inference of the DM status for each CpG site in every 
    cancer type, as well as to group them into different clusters according to the pan-cancer 
    DM patterns.
